## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Problem: Digital world overtakes the world of reading 
- This problem is relevant and worth solving because nowadays, people are glued to their gadgets unlike the old days when all we had were books. Although you can learn something from the internet, too much exposure may damage your eyes, unlike books.
- This problem can relate to our data set, which is from a library, because we can track how many people are still reading books and possibly promote reading to others.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
Objective 1: To identify key patterns and trends within the given data, such as averages, correlations, etc, that will provide valuable insights to users and easy analysis.

Objective 2: To create an interactive tool that allows users to visualize the data in meaningful ways to facilitate decision-making, and to easily find what they need or what they're looking for.

Objective 3: To integrate user-friendly features such as search filters and custom queries, making it easier for users to extract specific insights based on their needs, as well as the data that matches their requirements.

## 🧠 Logic Plan  
Choose **ONE** way to describe your program’s logic:  

### Option 1: Pseudocode

If user chooses "2", list all borrowed books
Repeat until user exits program


### Option 2: Flowchart  
Attach or draw a flowchart showing how the program will work.
